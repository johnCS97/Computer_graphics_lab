Hi, This project is all about Conway's life.

##Week 1 21/11/2021

Inital setup for python extensions on visual basic code.

Getting familiar with python.

Reading about conway's life.

Reading about <i>The game of life</i> algorithm.

Planing workflow and time management.

Time total: 3 hours.

Written the code of game of life on python.

Time total: 6 hours.

##Week 2 28/11/2021

Started reading about Smooth Life.

Came across a presentation about some of conway's game of life variations.

Started implementing Evan's larger than life.

Time total: 6 hours

Link to conway's game of life variations presentation:

##Week 3 5/12/2021

Found a bug in Evan's larger than life.

Evan's larger than life now works.

Translated the article "Generalization of Conway's Game of Life".

Total time: 5 hours

##Week 4 12/12/2021

Start implementing Smooth life.

Researching and studing more about it.

Total time: 9 hours

##Week 5 19/12/2021

Started version1 a slower with simple implementation.

Things not wotking well with animations.

Total time: 6 hours

##Week 6 26/12/2021

Animations working

Debugging smooth life version1.

Smooth life version1 now works.

Started working on smooth life version2.

version2 goal is to be faster

Total time : 9 hours

##Week 7 2/1/2022

Researched multiple ways to make kernel convulotion faster.

FFT2 from numpy is the easiest and fast enough.

Found the way to calculate the kernel.

Smooth life now works.

results seem good.

Total time : 12 hours

## Took a break to focus on exams

##Week 8 27/2/2022

Started planing the next part.

We have decided to implement game of life in 3D.

Did some research on matplotlib and the animation module.

Searched for an atricle that discribes the 3d version.

Total time : 7 hours

##Week 9 6/3/2022

Found an article you can find it in the reference folder.

Started implementation of Game of life 3D.

The game class is ready.

Tried a couple of things to check if the data is getting updated right.

Had some difficulties and tried to debug.

Total time : 6 hours

##Week 10 13/3/2022

Started to build the main class that would run the whole thing using matplotlib and the animation module.

Things didn't work well after a lot of debugging and tries, found out the problem.

Had to "clear" the figure between each frame and frame since ax.voxels doesn't initialize it's 3D array.

Finally things worked well and now Game of life 3D works.

screen records were sent to the discored channel you might find them as well in the videos folder/

Total time : 8 hours

##Week 11 20/3/2022

Did some improvements to the code.

Made it simpler.

Total time : 3 hours

##Week 27/3/2022

Took a break.

##Week 12 3/4/2022

Started planing the next part.

For this part of the project we will implement, smooth life in 3D.

We might use matplotlib and the animation module.

Probebly we will use FFT kernel.

Total time : 4 hours
