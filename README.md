Hi, This project is all about Conway's life.

##Week 1 21/11/2021

Inital setup for python extensions on visual basic code.

Getting familiar with python.

Reading about conway's life.

Reading about <i>The game of life</i> algorithm.

Planing workflow and time management.

Time total: 3 hours.

Written the code of game of life on python.

Time total: 6 hours.

##Week 2 28/11/2021

Started reading about Smooth Life.

Came across a presentation about some of conway's game of life variations.

Started implementing Evan's larger than life.

Time total: 6 hours

##Week 3 5/12/2021

Found a bug in Evan's larger than life.

Evan's larger than life now works.

Translated the article "Generalization of Conway's Game of Life".

Total time: 5 hours

##Week 4 12/12/2021

Start implementing Smooth life.

Researching and studing more about it.

Total time: 9 hours

##Week 5 19/12/2021

Started version1 a slower with simple implementation.

Things not wotking well with animations.

Total time: 6 hours

##Week 6 26/12/2021

Animations working

Debugging smooth life version1.

Smooth life version1 now works.

Started working on smooth life version2.

version2 goal is to be faster

Total time : 9 hours

##Week 7 2/1/2022

Researched multiple ways to make kernel convulotion faster.

FFT2 from numpy is the easiest and fast enough.

Found the way to calculate the kernel.

Smooth life now works.

results seem good.

Total time : 12 hours
